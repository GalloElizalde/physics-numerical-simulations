# Physics & Numerical Simulations 

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring canonical problems in theoretical and computational physics, with an emphasis on dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and variational principles. The notebooks combine analytical reasoning with numerical simulation and visualization.

## Contents

### `Random_walk`

Study of one- and higher-dimensional random walks. Includes numerical simulations, scaling behavior, and basic statistical properties (mean displacement, variance, diffusion-like limits).

### `Coupled_harmonic_oscillators`

Analysis of coupled harmonic oscillators. Covers equations of motion, normal modes, eigenfrequencies, and time evolution, with numerical solutions and phase-space visualizations.

### `Leats_action_principle`

Implementation and exploration of the principle of least action. Demonstrates how classical equations of motion emerge from variational principles, with illustrative examples and numerical checks.

### `Electric_pulse_analysis`

Numerical and qualitative analysis of systems driven by an external electric pulse. Focuses on time-dependent forcing, system response, and transient dynamics.

### `Bees_dynamics_analysis`

Exploratory modeling of collective or effective dynamics inspired by biological systems ("bees"). Emphasizes dynamical behavior, simplified interaction rules, and emergent patterns.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Common scientific libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`


Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently.
